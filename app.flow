# GitHub
    - Clone repo from Sanity studio template
    - update sanity.json at github with sanityProjectId
    - Add deploy key to created repo

# Netlify
    - create deploy key and get deploy key id
    - create new site based from repoOwner, repoName and deployKeyId created beforehand


# Sanity
    - create new project
    - add dataset
    - deploy graphql
    - add cors url based from where studio is uploaded
    - setup build hooks

    1.
        [Netlify] Create deploy key = deployKeyId, deployKey
        [Sanity] Create new sanity project = sanityProjectId
        [GitHub] Create new repo based from Sanity studio template = repoOwner, repoName

    2.
        [GitHub] Add deployKey to GitHub repo
        [GitHub] Update sanity.json with created sanityProjectId
        [Sanity] Create `production` dataset

    3.
        [Netlify] Create new site with created repoOwner, repoName and deployKeyId in previous steps = siteURL
        [Sanity] Deploy GraphQL with projectId and production dataset
